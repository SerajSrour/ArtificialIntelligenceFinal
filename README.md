# ArtificialIntelligenceFinal

In this project attached a data file on a particular disease, with each line describing a person. 
The first column indicates wether the person is ill or healthy. 
The other columns indicate all kinds of medical features of the same person. 
I was asked to implement a different learning algorithms that predicts if a person is ill or healthy from this disease, the algorthmys should be as accurate as possible.
