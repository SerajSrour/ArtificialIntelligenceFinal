# ArtificialIntelligenceFinal

In this project attached a data file on a particular disease, with each line describing a person. 
The first column indicates wether the person is ill or healthy. 
The other columns indicate all kinds of medical features of the same person. 
I was asked to implement a different learning algorithms that predicts if a person is ill or healthy from this disease, the algorthmys should be as accurate as possible.

The first part of the project was about ID3 algorythm and ID3 improvement, attached in the project all improvemnts I came up with achieving better accuracy and minimal loss.
While the second part was about coding KNN algorythm and improving it's accuracy. I chosed to modify the algorythm by giving weights to each feature, and by calculate the "feature error", an appropriate was given to it.
More detail can be found in the written project discription and analysis.

**PROJECT GRADE 99 !!**
